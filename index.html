            <h1>Land Area Vs Population Density</h1>
            <p>The land area and population density of a country are closely related.
        Population density is typically measured as the number of people per unit of area, often per square kilometer or mile. Therefore, a country with a large land area may have a lower population density if its population size is relatively small. Conversely, a small country with a large population will have a high population density. However, this relationship is not always straightforward. Factors such as geographical features, climate, economic opportunities, and social and political conditions can influence where people choose to live within a country. As a result, even countries with large land areas can have high population densities in certain regions.</p>
